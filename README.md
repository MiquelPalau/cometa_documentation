# Documentation

This is the starting point of Co.meta documentation. 

Co.meta stands for **co**mplete **me**ta **t**est **a**utomation. Meta (from the Greek μετα-, meta-, meaning "after" or "beyond") is a prefix meaning more comprehensive or transcending. [source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta). With Co.meta you can test over systemboundaries, you can go to one application, fetch data and save it in variables. Then go to another application and use the data to test against content or use it as search input ...

Co.meta uses a now-code / low-code approach to define test steps. 

## What is a Testplan / Feature

A testplan or feature consists of general information, browser selection, and the steps / actions that should be executed one after the other. 

So what is the difference between a Testplan or a Feature?

When we speak of something that we want to test - what do we mean?  Do we want to test a Login or a menu functionality? Do we want to test a navigation path?
Is that a feature of our application? Or is that a testplan.

So, to get things right:

* a feature in our world is a building block. We want to test a feature (one single behaviour) on mobile and on desktop.
* several feature will the be grouped into a testplan.

So testing a whole application consists of testing many features on different devices. That is a testplan.



### General Section 

The first Chapter provides information on steps / actions to be used in your testplan.

We will commit documentation as soon as possible. Come back soon. Watch the repo to be notified as soon as we are done.
